## How to use

For the big iPod, you need to ensure the touch sensors are connected to COM3, and the lights are connected to COM21.

Group your songs by folder and put them in `MaiCharts\`, and you are good to go.

If you are not satisfied with audio latency, you can use an asio driver. [ASIO4ALL](https://asio4all.org/about/download-asio4all/) is a common choice.

If you encounter desync issues, try to tweak the sound control pannel: Turn off all audio enhancements and allow exclusive control.

## Online Charts

The api endpoints fills in by default now. 

Change `Online` to `true` in `setting.json` if you want to pull online charts from [Majnet](https://majdata.net). 

If you have majnet account, you can login by modify `setting.json` to enable chart reaction.
